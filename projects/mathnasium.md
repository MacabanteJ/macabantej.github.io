## What is Mathnasium?

[Mathnasium](https://www.mathnasium.com/) is a math learning franchise that has over 1,000 centers that span North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The goal of Mathnasium is to provide math instruction to students from pre-kindergarten all the way through high school. Mathnasium focuses on teaching math as a thought process as opposed to memorization and techniques. We strive to impart a logical thinking process and the tools to solve more than just math problems.


## What I Learned

I am an instructor at the [Mathnasium of Waialae](https://www.mathnasium.com/waialae). Throughout this amazing opportunity, I have been able to interact with kids ranging from 4 years old all the way through current high school Seniors. I have taught math concepts ranging from the four basic operations to partial fraction decomposition. Being able to teach a variety of students allows me to see different perspectives of math. My skills in communication have evolved because of the diverse age range of students that I see multiple times a week.
