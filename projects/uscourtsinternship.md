## Internship Overview: Web Development, User Interface Design, and Data Management

Throughout my summer internship at the [U.S. Courts](https://www.hid.uscourts.gov/home), I had the opportunity to contribute to various projects involving web development, user interface design, and data management. This overview showcases my key accomplishments and contributions during this internship.

## Web Development:

One of my primary responsibilities was leveraging ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library, to develop a comprehensive services page for the office's website. By incorporating data retrieved from a SQL relational database, I implemented a dynamic and user-friendly page and components. This page seamlessly integrated information from two distinct services offered by the office, providing visitors with a cohesive experience. The development process involved utilizing my skills in ReactJS, HTML, and CSS to ensure the effective presentation of relevant information.

## User Interface Design:

Recognizing the importance of enhancing the website's functionality and user experience, I designed and developed a specialized component. This component enabled users to effortlessly download files via hyperlinks, streamlining the process and improving accessibility. By implementing intuitive design principles and leveraging my proficiency in front-end development technologies, I contributed to an enhanced user interface that simplified file retrieval and improved overall usability.

## Data Management:

In addition to web development, I had the opportunity to develop a Microsoft Power Apps application for data management. Leveraging SharePoint lists and advanced querying techniques, I independently created an application that facilitated efficient data management processes within the office. This involved creating a user-friendly interface, implementing data validation rules, and optimizing querying capabilities to ensure accurate and streamlined data retrieval. Through this project, I strengthened my proficiency in Microsoft Power Apps and demonstrated my ability to develop practical solutions for data management challenges.
