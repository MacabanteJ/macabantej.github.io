## Desire

Ever since I was young I was fascinated by video games and wanted to know how they were created. After doing lots of research and watching tons of tutorial videos, I realized that making video games was not for me. However, I found that programming was a powerful skill that allows you to make more than just forms of entertainment. I have always wanted to contribute to my family, especially my parents. From a young age I have asked them “What do you guys want?”. I naively thought they would present me with some kind of burden that they have had and that I would magically be able to solve it for them. I knew that programming would be my way of giving back to them; however, I’m still figuring out how.

## Skills

The main skill that I want to learn is how to effectively develop pieces of software. While this may sound simple, I mean the whole process - like everything about it. I want to learn how to best identify problems and brainstorm solutions that could be implemented through an application. In terms of specific programming skills, I would like to learn how to combine HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a web application. I have had experience with these languages before; however, I would like to dive deeper into JavaScript and CSS to create a personal website that would stand out because it is unique to me and me alone.

## Future

I plan on starting out with baby steps. I definitely would not be able to create a life-saving application overnight, I recognize that I need the appropriate stepping stones to be able to build complex applications. The first step I will take is to create a web autobiography of my family. My parents have sacrificed a lot for me and my siblings have been a great support system for me growing up. I would like for them to be able to look back on our history, to be able to laugh, cry, and reminisce about the smallest events that have impacted our lives.
