# Overview
<img class ="ui small right floated rounded image" src="/images/spotify-logo.png">
The problem:
While studying, working out, or doing various activities, students would like to listen to appropriate music, but are not sure how to efficiently explore songs for certain situations. Students may also want to know what their peers are listening to just to spice up their own playlists.


The solution:
A web app that allows students to share their Spotify playlists across all University of Hawaii campuses. Users will be able to upload their Spotify playlists, categorizing them with tags, enabling users to search for playlists that other students have created for a certain activity.

# Approach
Users will be able to create an account that is linked to their Spotify account. They will be able to share a biography, their selected major, and include a list of hobbies and interests. Users can upload Spotify playlists and tag them according to the genre or associated activity. Users will also be able to browse through playlists created by users of similar majors, hobbies, and interests, or specifically search for playlists tagged “workout”, “studying”, and more.

# Pages
- Sign Up Page: Input username, major, interests, age, and link to Spotify account
- Browse: Filter through tags, majors, and interests to find what other people at UH are listening to
- Share Playlists: Share a playlist that exists on your Spotify account and add different tags, such as workout, cooking, or study
- Your Playlists: Playlists you’ve shared and an option to delete
- Admin: Delete playlists or remove users

# Use case ideas
- UH user signs up 
- Browses for playlists then adds the playlist to their own profile, or takes songs they especially like from it to build on their own playlists
- Eventually, they choose to share their own playlists and contribute to the community

# Beyond the basics
- Aggregate data for a statistics page (Most common songs by major, etc)
- Expand music services (Apple Music, SoundCloud)
- A recommendation engine (probably too much work)
